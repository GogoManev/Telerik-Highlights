        <h3>Patch Notes:</h3> <br>
        <h4>8.2.2025: </h4>
        <b>Made this project ;)</b> <b>Every game now has a "Go Back" and "Restart" buttons under (or above) the game canvas</b> <br>
        <a><b>Hit the Ball:</b> Fixed collisions between the mouse and the ball and increased the difficulty. Every 5 points, the ball becomes faster</a> <br>
        <a><b>Racer:</b> Swapped controls (WASD for Player 1, Arrows for Player 2). Decreased the enemy helicopters form 100 to 50. </a> <br>
        <a><b>Breakout:</b> Fixed a bug where balls won't spawn on the first click and where the maximum balls weren't 10.</a> <br>
        <a><b>cock cliccer:</b> Fixed several bugs: When your points would not match the points you had prior to refreshing the page, when the updates </a> <br>
        <a>weren't registered after refreshing, where autoclick began automatically and would not register when the game has been refreshed. </a><br>
        <a>The autoclick upgrade now gives points at a slower rate. Increased the points requirement for future additional points upgrades.</a> <br>
        <a>Using upgrades now charges the amount of points you needed. Removed the unused shop section. Changed some text strings.</a>
